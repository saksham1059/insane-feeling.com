        Some of the voices in my head screams <br>
        A loss which frights me even in dreams <br>
        A misunderstanding created a hole <br>
        Someone's manupulations too played a great role <br>
         
        Everyone gained but i was the one who lost <br>
        My trust was broken by the one i loved most <br>
        Loosing my best friend made me loose my sanity <br>
        As he only tried to defend his own vanity <br>
         
        I thought him to be my friend forever <br>
       But forever turned too small however <br>
       My best friend was supposed to handle me everytime <br>
       So how could i handle the fact that my BEST FRIEND was not mine ? <br>
        
      Yeah i annoyed you and you used to piss me off <br>
      We used to fight and we used to scoff <br>
      I used to get mad and pretend that i wouldn't talk <br>
       And you used to pamper me until i held your hand to walk <br>
       
      Where did all that love and care go ? <br>
      For the first time i asked you to wait and you said "NO" <br>
      One misunderstanding and we were no longer BEST FRIENDS <br>
      Is this how our bond and our friendship ends ? <br>
      IS THIS HOW IT ALL ENDS ??<br>
